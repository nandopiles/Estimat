We have carried out a profound renovation of the Estima't Association's website, with the aim of making it more interactive and keeping it constantly updated, thus providing a more dynamic and accessible platform for users. We decided to collaborate with this association because we believe it is a topic that needs more visibility and support from society. 

<h2>How does it work?</h2>
The website consists of various sections, ranging from detailed information about the disease and the association's work, to relevant news and image galleries showcasing activities such as assemblies and workshops organized by the association. Additionally, it features an internal platform that facilitates efficient management of all content.

As visiting users of the website, we will have complete access to all displayed content, as well as the ability to log in with our personal accounts to highlight those news items that interest us the most. On the other hand, as administrators, we will have full access to the internal management of the application, allowing us to add, edit, and delete both news items and images, as well as user profiles as necessary. 

On our website, we have enabled a contact section that offers users the possibility to communicate with the association via email or social media. Additionally, we have integrated an interactive map that shows the physical location of the association, making it easier for users who wish to visit in person.

<h2>Technical Operation</h2>
The project has been divided into two distinct parts: the front-end, developed in Angular, and the back-end, implemented using Symfony and MySQL. To facilitate project management and portability, we have chosen to use Docker images and containers. This decision allows us to maintain a consistent and reproducible development and deployment environment, simplifying collaboration between developers and ensuring greater consistency in the system's operation across different environments.

## User Guide

- Download the .ZIP file and navigate to the `my-project` folder, then start our Docker container via command line
```bash
  cd my-project
  docker-compose up -d
```

- Once the container is up and running, navigate to the my-app folder and install Angular
```bash
  cd my-app
  npm install
  port: 4200
```

- After everything is installed, start the server to preview the project.
```bash
  ng serve
```

- This command will open the browser, allowing us to access the application. ðŸš€
